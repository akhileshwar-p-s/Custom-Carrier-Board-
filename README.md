# Custom-Carrier-Board
Designed and built on a zero-PCB for a multi-functional robot! This board integrates an Arduino Nano, TB6612FNG motor driver, LM7805 voltage regulator, capacitor, and other components to create a compact solution for:

•Line Follower
•Line Maze Solver
•Wall Maze Solver

This PCB simplifies the assembly of robots by providing an all-in-one platform for these functionalities.
